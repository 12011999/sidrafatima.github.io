> *“If I were working in a data-driven organization, this is the kind of dashboard I’d build to monitor operations, track KPIs, and support better decision-making.”*

### 🎯 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard suite was designed to simulate the analytical responsibilities of a data professional in **operations, logistics, or inventory management** roles. It combines real-world scenarios like **inventory trends**, **vendor performance**, and **order fulfillment** to deliver actionable insights.


### 🧠 Why It Matters

Organizations rely on data to ensure their operations run efficiently. This dashboard suite consolidates key metrics—such as **stock levels, lead times, delivery rates, and reorder thresholds**—into a centralized view that supports:

- Reducing stockouts and delays  
- Improving vendor accountability  
- Forecasting demand and replenishment  
- Enhancing strategic planning and reporting

It’s a practical demonstration of how modern analytics tools like Power BI can translate raw data into smarter decisions.
