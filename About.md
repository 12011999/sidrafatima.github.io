Hi, I’m **Sidra Fatima**, a data analyst with a passion for turning healthcare and pharma data into stories that improve lives.

With a strong foundation in computer science and a Master’s in Business Analytics, I specialize in using tools like **Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI** to explore trends, build dashboards, and generate insights.

This portfolio is where I share the projects, challenges, and lessons from my journey. Whether it’s predicting hospital readmissions, visualizing drug trial outcomes, or exploring healthcare access gaps, I believe data can—and should—be used with purpose.

Let’s connect and collaborate!
