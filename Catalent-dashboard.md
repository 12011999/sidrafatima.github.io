> *“If I were a Data and Project Analyst at Catalent, this is the kind of dashboard I’d build to track KPIs, streamline internal reports, and support better decisions.”*

### 🎯 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard was built to simulate the real-world responsibilities of a Data & Project Analyst at Catalent. It brings together inventory, order fulfillment, and vendor performance data to visualize key supply chain metrics across manufacturing sites.

### 🧠 Why It Matters

Catalent’s mission to deliver critical therapies faster and more reliably depends on clear, actionable insights from supply chain operations. This dashboard provides a centralized view to monitor on-time delivery, lead times, inventory levels, and backorder status—all of which are critical to proactive decision-making.
